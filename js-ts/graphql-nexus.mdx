# GraphQL Nexus

Declarative, Code-First GraphQL Schemas for JavaScript/TypeScript

---

# Type-Safe by Default

GraphQL Nexus' APIs were designed with type-safety in mind. 
We auto-generate type-definitions as you develop, and infer them 
in your code, giving you IDE completion and type error catching 
out of the box!

---

# Works With The Ecosystem

Nexus can work with existing graphql-js types when 
constructing its schema. The generated schema works with your 
favorite tools like Apollo Server or GraphQL middleware.

---

# Data-Agnostic

GraphQL Nexus is just a declarative syntax layered on the 
graphql-js library. Whatever you can do with graphql-js or 
apollo-tools, you can do with Nexus.
